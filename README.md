# Fast movement shooter
## Customizable, simple, custom & tested
This is a FREE controller for Unity that contains my own custom made boomer shooter-like movement (camera tilting, velocity Y axis camera movement - on fall mostly, view bobbing, ...)

## How to use
Simply download these files, put them in your Unity project (except LICENSE & README.md), 
drag them to the scene (or Hierarchy), configure for your needs in the inspector 
and enjoy!
